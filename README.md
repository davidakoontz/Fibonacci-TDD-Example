#  Fibonacci-TDD-Kata-Swift5 Release v1.0 Starter Project

## This release has some very very basic Object Model Classes:

- FibonacciSequence.swift - a class with a static method fib()

Start with this peusudo code.

Fib(0) should return 0
Fib(1) should return 1
Fib(1) should return 2
Fib(2) should return 3
Fib(3) should return 5
Fib(5) should return 8

... continue until you have a well factored and concise Fib() function... Red-Green-Refactor.



### Start here and start writing test cases - implementation code - some UI - in SwiftUI and you can have a great learning experience.
